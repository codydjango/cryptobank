# CryptoBank

This is an exercise in crypto primitives. I've decided to use the sodium-native library.

The exercise requirements are documented here: [https://github.com/sodium-friends/learntocrypto](https://github.com/sodium-friends/learntocrypto).

To run, first run the bank server `node bank.js` and then run the teller client in another terminal `node teller.js`.
